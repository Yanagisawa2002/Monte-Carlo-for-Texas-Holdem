# Monte-Carlo-for-Texas-Holdem
本代码使用蒙特卡洛算法，可以计算德州扑克中，玩家的胜率为多少。  
在查看手中两张牌、亮明三张公牌、亮明一张公牌、亮明一张公牌的这四个过程中，玩家会依次获得当前状态对应的胜率，从而更好地进行决策。  
This code utilizes the Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the probability of a player winning in Texas Hold'em poker.  
During the four stages—viewing two hole cards, the reveal of three community cards, the reveal of one additional community card, and the reveal of another community card—the player receives real-time win probability updates corresponding to the current game state. This enables them to make better decisions throughout the hand.
